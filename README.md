We are team 16 and in this repository, we put the Hardware Project of the Microprocessors Course taught at EEE Department, Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

In this project, we built a BI-Model Robot that can be controlled via a mobile application through Wi-Fi, or can operate as a self-driving car that can avoid obstacles.
